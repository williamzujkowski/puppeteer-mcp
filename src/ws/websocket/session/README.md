# WebSocket Session Management - Modular Architecture

## Overview

The WebSocket session management system has been refactored from a single 477-line file into a
modular architecture with specialized components, each under 300 lines. The design follows SOLID
principles and implements several design patterns for better maintainability and extensibility.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **SessionLifecycleManager** (209 lines)
   - Manages session creation, validation, and termination
   - Implements periodic cleanup
   - Pattern: Template Method for lifecycle operations

2. **SessionStateManager** (253 lines)
   - Handles session state transitions using State pattern
   - Manages session storage and retrieval
   - Enforces state transition rules

3. **SessionEventEmitter** (107 lines)
   - Type-safe event management using Observer pattern
   - Provides event-driven architecture for session events
   - Supports lifecycle, state change, and security events

4. **SessionSecurityLogger** (159 lines)
   - Centralized security event logging
   - NIST compliance annotations
   - Audit trail management

5. **SessionPersistenceManager** (228 lines)
   - Handles session persistence and recovery
   - Implements batch operations for efficiency
   - Supports configurable flush intervals

6. **SessionValidationManager** (252 lines)
   - Extensible validation rules
   - Custom validator support
   - Connection and permission validation

7. **SessionStatisticsManager** (256 lines)
   - Real-time session metrics
   - Performance monitoring
   - Statistical analysis and reporting

8. **SessionFactory** (130 lines)
   - Factory pattern for component creation
   - Dependency injection
   - Component wiring and configuration

## Design Patterns

- **State Pattern**: Session state management with defined transitions
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven architecture for session events
- **Factory Pattern**: Component creation and dependency injection
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable validation rules
- **Template Method**: Lifecycle operations

## Key Features

- **Backward Compatibility**: Original SessionManager API preserved
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict typing
- **NIST Compliance**: Security annotations throughout
- **ESLint Compliance**: Following project standards
- **Modular Design**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features without modifying existing code

## Usage

```typescript
// Original API still works
const sessionManager = new SessionManager(dependencies, options);
sessionManager.start();

// Create or update session
await sessionManager.createOrUpdateSession(sessionId, userId, connectionId, {
  roles: ['user'],
  permissions: ['read'],
});

// Validate session
const isValid = await sessionManager.validateSession(sessionId, connectionManager);

// Get statistics
const stats = sessionManager.getSessionStats();
```

## Security Features

- Session limit enforcement per user
- Automatic session expiration
- Security event logging with NIST tags
- Permission-based validation
- State-based access control

## Performance Optimizations

- Batch persistence operations
- Efficient state transitions
- Lazy loading of session data
- Configurable cleanup intervals
- Memory-efficient statistics tracking

## Testing

The module includes comprehensive tests for backward compatibility, ensuring that existing code
continues to work without modification after the refactoring.
