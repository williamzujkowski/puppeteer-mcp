# Redis Migration Module

This module provides a comprehensive migration system for Redis session stores, refactored from the original monolithic `redis-migration.ts` file into focused, maintainable components.

## Architecture

The module follows SOLID principles and implements several design patterns:

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Template Method Pattern** (`base-migration.ts`)
   - Defines the skeleton of migration operations
   - Allows subclasses to override specific steps

2. **Strategy Pattern** (backup, restore, transfer strategies)
   - Encapsulates different migration algorithms
   - Makes them interchangeable

3. **Factory Pattern** (`migration-factory.ts`)
   - Creates migration strategies based on type
   - Centralizes object creation

4. **Facade Pattern** (`migration-manager.ts`)
   - Provides a unified interface to all migration operations
   - Simplifies complex subsystem interactions

## Module Structure

├── index.ts                 # Module exports
├── types.ts                 # Type definitions
├── base-migration.ts        # Abstract base class (Template Method)
├── migration-factory.ts     # Factory for creating strategies
├── migration-manager.ts     # Unified interface (Facade)
├── backup-strategy.ts       # Backup implementation
├── restore-strategy.ts      # Restore implementation
├── transfer-strategy.ts     # Transfer between Redis instances

```

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each component under 200 lines for maintainability
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types
- **NIST Compliance**: Security annotations throughout
- **Backward Compatibility**: Original API preserved through re-exports
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and reporting
- **Performance**: Batch processing for large datasets
- **Flexibility**: Multiple options for each operation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Backup

```typescript
const manager = new MigrationManager(logger);
const result = await manager.backupSessions(
  redisClient,
  '/path/to/backup.json',
  { preserveTTL: true }
);
```

### Full Migration Workflow

```typescript
const result = await manager.fullMigration(
  sourceClient,
  targetClient,
  {
    batchSize: 100,
    preserveTTL: true,
    backupPath: '/path/to/backup.json'
  }
);
```

### Custom Strategy Usage

```typescript
const factory = new MigrationFactory(logger);
const backupStrategy = factory.createBackupStrategy();

const result = await backupStrategy.execute({
  client: redisClient,
  backupPath: '/path/to/backup.json',
  options: { preserveTTL: true, compress: false }
});
```

## Migration Safety

- Validates all data before operations
- Supports dry-run mode for testing
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- Comprehensive logging at each step
- Rollback capabilities through backups

## Performance Considerations

- Configurable batch sizes for large datasets
- Progress tracking for long operations
- Minimal memory footprint through streaming
- Parallel processing where applicable

## Security Features

- NIST control compliance (CP-9, CP-10, AC-3, SI-10)
- Input validation on all operations
- Secure session data handling
- Audit trail through comprehensive logging
