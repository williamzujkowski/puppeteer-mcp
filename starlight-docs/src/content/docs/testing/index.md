### ðŸŽ¯ [Acceptance Testing](/testing/acceptance-testing)
End-to-end acceptance testing procedures and automated testing frameworks.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows these principles:

- **Security-First**: Every feature must pass security validation
- **Performance-Aware**: All changes are benchmarked for performance impact
- **User-Centric**: Testing prioritizes actual user workflows and scenarios
- **Automated**: Maximum automation with manual validation for edge cases
- **Continuous**: Testing is integrated into CI/CD pipelines

## Quick Start

1. **Set up your testing environment** following the [Installation Guide](/quickstart/installation)
2. **Choose your testing focus** from the categories above
3. **Follow the specific testing procedures** in each section
4. **Integrate with CI/CD** using our [Operations Guide](/operations/ci-cd)

## Testing Tools

The framework leverages:
- **Jest** for unit and integration testing
- **Puppeteer** for browser automation testing
- **Artillery** for load and performance testing
- **Custom security scanners** for vulnerability assessment
- **GitHub Actions** for continuous testing

## Support
