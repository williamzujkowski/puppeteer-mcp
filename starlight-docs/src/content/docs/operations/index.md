# Operations Guide

This section covers production operations, continuous integration/deployment, and maintenance procedures for Puppeteer MCP. Whether you're running in development or production, these guides provide the operational knowledge needed for reliable service delivery.

## Operations Areas

### ðŸ”„ [CI/CD Pipeline](/operations/ci-cd)
Comprehensive guide to the continuous integration and deployment pipeline, including GitHub Actions workflows, testing automation, and deployment strategies.

### ðŸ“¦ [Version Management](/operations/version-management)
Version control procedures, release management, and semantic versioning strategies for maintaining stable releases.

### ðŸš¨ [Error Handling](/operations/error-handling)
Production error handling strategies, monitoring, alerting, and recovery procedures for maintaining service reliability.

## Operational Philosophy

Our operations approach emphasizes:

- **Automation First**: Minimize manual intervention through comprehensive automation
- **Observability**: Full visibility into system behavior through metrics, logs, and traces
- **Reliability**: Design for failure with graceful degradation and recovery
- **Security**: Operations procedures include security validation at every step
- **Scalability**: Operations scale with the platform from development to enterprise

## Key Operational Capabilities

### **Continuous Integration**
- Automated testing across all protocols and features
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Performance regression detection
- Documentation validation and updates

### **Deployment Automation**
- Multi-environment deployment (dev, staging, production)
- Rolling deployments with health checks
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Configuration management

### **Monitoring & Observability**
- Real-time metrics and alerting
- Distributed tracing across services
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance monitoring and SLA tracking

### **Incident Response**
- Automated incident detection
- Escalation procedures and runbooks
- Post-incident analysis and improvement
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Getting Started with Operations

1. **Review the [CI/CD Pipeline](/operations/ci-cd)** to understand automation workflows
2. **Set up [Version Management](/operations/version-management)** procedures for your team
3. **Implement [Error Handling](/operations/error-handling)** strategies for production readiness
4. **Configure monitoring** using the [Telemetry Guide](/guides/advanced/telemetry)
