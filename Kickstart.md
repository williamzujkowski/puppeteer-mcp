## üöÄ Project Kickstart Assistant

I need help implementing a project based on my project plan. I'll provide the plan content below, and I'd like you to:

### 1. **Analyze & Identify** (Auto-Detection)
- Detect the project type, tech stack, and languages
- Identify frameworks, databases, and infrastructure needs
- Recognize architectural patterns and deployment targets
- Note any compliance or security requirements

### 2. **Standards Mapping** (From: https://github.com/williamzujkowski/standards)
> üí° **Note**: For creating new standards, see [CREATING_STANDARDS_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/standards/blob/master/CREATING_STANDARDS_GUIDE.md)
Based on the detected technologies, recommend relevant standards:
- **Code Standards (CS):** Language-specific best practices
- **Testing Standards (TS):** Testing frameworks and coverage requirements
- **Security Standards (SEC):** Security patterns and authentication
- **Frontend/Backend (FE/WD):** UI/UX and API standards
- **Infrastructure (CN/DOP):** Container and deployment standards
- **Data Engineering (DE):** Database and data pipeline standards
- **Legal/Compliance (LEG):** Privacy and regulatory requirements
- **NIST Compliance (NIST-IG):** NIST 800-53r5 control tagging ([NIST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/standards/blob/master/NIST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md))

### 3. **Implementation Blueprint**
Create a structured implementation plan with:
- Project scaffold/boilerplate structure
- Core dependencies and toolchain setup
- Development workflow (git flow, CI/CD)
- Testing strategy and coverage targets
- Security checklist and authentication approach
- Compliance requirements (NIST controls for security features)
- Deployment pipeline and monitoring

### 4. **Code Generation**
Provide starter code for:
- Project configuration files (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Docker/container setup if applicable
- Basic application skeleton following identified standards
- Testing setup and example tests
- Security configurations and middleware

### 5. **Quality Gates**
Define automated checks for:
- Code style and linting rules
- Test coverage thresholds
- Security scanning requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation standards

### 6. **Tool Recommendations**
Suggest modern tools for:
- **Required:** Essential tools for the detected stack
- **Recommended:** Tools that enhance developer experience
- **Optional:** Nice-to-have tools for advanced workflows

## My Project Plan:

Below is a three-phase blueprint for building your ‚ÄúMCP‚Äù API platform in Node.js, followed by successive refinement into iterative chunks, and finally a set of self-contained prompts you can feed to a code-generation LLM. Each prompt builds on the last, drives towards a solid, test-driven MVP, and ends by wiring new pieces into the growing system.

---

## Phase 1: High-Level Blueprint

1. **Project Initialization**

   * Scaffold a TypeScript/ESM Node.js project
   * Set up eslint/prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks
   * Configure Jest or Mocha for TDD

2. **REST API Layer**

   * Choose framework (Express or Fastify with HTTP/2)
   * Define core CRUD resources (`/sessions`, `/contexts`)
   * Implement versioning and validation
   * Add logging, error handling, and health checks

3. **gRPC Layer**

   * Define `.proto` files for service (e.g. `ControlService`, `StreamService`)
   * Generate TypeScript stubs (`@grpc/proto-loader` + `@grpc/grpc-js`)
   * Implement unary and streaming RPCs
   * Add interceptors for auth and logging

4. **WebSocket Layer**

   * Pick a library (`ws` or Socket.IO)
   * Define message envelope (JSON or Protobuf framing)
   * Implement server and client examples
   * Secure via WSS and origin checks

5. **Shared Core**

   * Session/context models
   * Common utilities (logging, config, error types)
   * Authentication/authorization middleware (API keys, JWT, OAuth2)

6. **Testing & CI**

   * Unit tests for each module
   * Integration tests covering end-to-end flows
   * GitHub Actions for lint/test/build on push

---

## Phase 2: Iterative Chunking

### Chunk Group A: Project Foundations

1. **A1.** Init repo, tsconfig, package.json
2. **A2.** Lint/prettier, Husky hooks
3. **A3.** Basic test runner setup

### Chunk Group B: REST MVP

1. **B1.** Create `src/server.ts` with HTTP/2 server
2. **B2.** Define `/health` endpoint + tests
3. **B3.** Scaffold `/sessions` router, in-memory store + tests
4. **B4.** Add validation & error-handler middleware

### Chunk Group C: gRPC MVP

1. **C1.** Write `control.proto` (Session RPCs)
2. **C2.** Generate TypeScript stubs
3. **C3.** Implement and test unary RPCs
4. **C4.** Add a bidi stream method

### Chunk Group D: WebSocket MVP

1. **D1.** Integrate `ws` server into existing HTTP/2 server
2. **D2.** Define handshake and simple echo test
3. **D3.** Implement broadcast events for context changes
4. **D4.** Add auth check on WS connection

### Chunk Group E: Integration & Hardening

1. **E1.** Wire REST ‚Üí gRPC ‚Üí WS in one process
2. **E2.** Add JWT-based auth across all layers
3. **E3.** End-to-end tests (REST‚ÜíWS roundtrip)
4. **E4.** CI pipeline + Dockerfile

---

## Phase 3: Right-Sized Steps

We‚Äôll break each chunk into 2‚Äì4 small steps that include test scaffolding, implementation, and integration:

### Example: Chunk B3 ‚Üí Sessions Router

1. **B3.1** Write a Jest unit test for `SessionStore` interface:

   ```ts
   test('SessionStore: create and fetch', async () => {
     const store = new InMemorySessionStore();
     const id = await store.create({ user: 'alice' });
     expect(await store.get(id)).toMatchObject({ user: 'alice' });
   });
   ```
2. **B3.2** Implement `InMemorySessionStore` to satisfy the test.
3. **B3.3** Write an integration test for `GET /sessions/:id`.
4. **B3.4** Implement Express router for `/sessions` that uses the store, passing the integration test.

You would do this for every chunk until the system is fully wired.

---

## Phase 4: Code-Generation Prompts

Below each section is a single prompt (wrapped in triple-backticks) you can hand off to a code-generation LLM. **Each prompt** includes context, the exact task, testing requirements, and wiring instructions.

---

### Prompt 1: Project Init & Testing

```text
You are bootstrapping a new Node.js MVP for the ‚ÄúMCP‚Äù API server. Create a repository skeleton with:
- `package.json` configured for TypeScript (ESM), top-level `await`
- Scripts: lint, format, build, test
- `tsconfig.json` targeting ES2020
- ESLint and Prettier configs
- Husky pre-commit hooks that run lint and format
- Jest (or Mocha+Chai) initialized with a simple example test file

Ensure linting and tests pass on `npm test`. No business logic yet.
```

---

### Prompt 2: Health Check Endpoint

```text
Add a TCP HTTP/2 server in `src/server.ts` that listens on port 8443.
Implement a `/health` GET endpoint returning `{ status: 'ok' }`.
Write Jest tests verifying:
- Server starts without error
- GET `/health` returns 200 and correct JSON
Run lint, build, test, and confirm green build.
```

---

### Prompt 3: In-Memory Session Store

````text
Implement `src/store/SessionStore.ts` defining an interface:
```ts
interface SessionStore {
  create(data: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<string>;
  get(id: string): Promise<Record<string, unknown> | null>;
}
````

Create `InMemorySessionStore` in `src/store/InMemorySessionStore.ts` using a Map.
Write Jest unit tests to cover `create` and `get` as described.
Ensure tests pass.

````

---

### Prompt 4: Sessions REST Router

```text
In `src/routes/sessions.ts`, create an Express router that:
- `POST /sessions` calls `store.create` and returns `{ id }`
- `GET /sessions/:id` calls `store.get` and returns data or 404
Write integration tests using Supertest:
- Creating a session returns 201 and ID
- Fetching returns the original data
Wire router into `src/server.ts` under `/sessions`.
````

---

### Prompt 5: gRPC Control Service

````text
Create `proto/control.proto` with a `ControlService`:
```proto
service ControlService {
  rpc CreateSession(CreateRequest) returns (CreateResponse);
  rpc GetSession(GetRequest) returns (GetResponse);
}
message CreateRequest { map<string, string> data = 1; }
message CreateResponse { string id = 1; }
message GetRequest { string id = 1; }
message GetResponse { map<string, string> data = 1; }
````

Use `@grpc/proto-loader` and `@grpc/grpc-js` to generate TypeScript stubs.
Implement the server handlers to call your `InMemorySessionStore`.
Write Mocha or Jest tests for the unary RPCs.

````

---

### Prompt 6: WebSocket Echo & Auth

```text
Add WebSocket support using the `ws` library in `src/ws.ts`.
On server startup, mount the WebSocket server on the same HTTP/2 listener.
Implement:
- Echo server: send back any text message
- JWT-based auth: clients must send `?token=...` in connection URL and reject unauthorized
Write unit tests mocking WebSocket connections for both auth success and failure.
````

---

*(Continue in this pattern for the remaining chunks ‚Äì C3, C4, D3, D4, E1‚ÄìE4 ‚Äì each time stating exactly what file(s) to edit, what tests to write first, what implementation to follow, and how to wire into existing modules.)*

---

With these prompts, you can steadily drive a code-generation LLM through every milestone of your Node.js MCP server, with tests first, clear increments, and no orphaned code.
