# Security Test Summary for puppeteer-mcp

## Overview

I have created a comprehensive security test suite for puppeteer-mcp that validates input
sanitization, XSS prevention, and protection against various security vulnerabilities. The test
suite covers all major security vulnerability categories relevant to browser automation.

## Test Scripts Created

### 1. Core Security Tests (10 test files)

1. **xss-prevention.test.ts** - Tests for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities
2. **path-traversal.test.ts** - Tests for directory traversal attacks
3. **command-injection.test.ts** - Tests for command execution vulnerabilities
4. **ssrf-prevention.test.ts** - Tests for Server-Side Request Forgery
5. **csp-bypass.test.ts** - Tests for Content Security Policy bypasses
6. **cookie-security.test.ts** - Tests for cookie security issues
7. **auth-bypass.test.ts** - Tests for authentication bypass vulnerabilities
8. **resource-exhaustion.test.ts** - Tests for DoS and resource exhaustion
9. **prototype-pollution.test.ts** - Tests for prototype pollution attacks
10. **unsafe-js-execution.test.ts** - Tests for unsafe JavaScript execution

### 2. Test Infrastructure

- **run-security-tests.ts** - Main test runner that executes all tests and generates reports
- **package.json** - Test dependencies and scripts
- **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration
- **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation

## Key Security Areas Tested

### Critical Security Tests

1. **XSS Prevention**
   - URL parameter injection
   - DOM-based XSS
   - Stored XSS
   - Event handler injection
   - Script tag injection

2. **Command Injection**
   - Shell command execution
   - Process spawning
   - Template injection
   - Code evaluation

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - SQL injection
   - Token manipulation
   - Privilege escalation
   - Session management

### High Priority Tests

1. **SSRF Prevention**
   - Internal network access
   - DNS rebinding
   - URL parser confusion
   - Protocol smuggling

2. **Path Traversal**
   - File system access
   - Directory traversal
   - Path normalization

3. **Prototype Pollution**
   - Object prototype modification
   - JSON parsing vulnerabilities
   - Property injection

### Medium Priority Tests

1. **CSP Bypass**
   - Policy enforcement
   - Inline script execution
   - Nonce/hash validation

2. **Cookie Security**
   - Secure attributes
   - HttpOnly enforcement
   - SameSite validation

3. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Memory limits
   - CPU usage
   - Network flooding

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
cd /home/william/git/puppeteer-mcp/testing/paperclips-game/security-tests
npm install
npm run test:security
```

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
npm run test:xss          # XSS tests
npm run test:auth         # Authentication tests
npm run test:ssrf         # SSRF tests
# ... etc
```

## Initial Test Results

Based on the initial test run, several areas require attention:

### Findings

1. **XSS Vulnerabilities**
   - Some HTML injection vectors are not properly sanitized
   - DOM-based XSS protections need strengthening
   - document.write() is not properly restricted

2. **Timeout Issues**
   - Some tests timeout due to network requests
   - May indicate unhandled promise rejections

3. **CSP Headers**
   - Content Security Policy headers may not be present on test URLs
   - This is expected for external sites but should be verified for puppeteer-mcp endpoints

## Recommendations for Production Security

### Immediate Actions

1. **Input Validation**
   - Implement strict input validation for all user-provided data
   - Use allowlists for URLs and file paths
   - Sanitize all HTML content before rendering

2. **Security Headers**
   - Implement Content Security Policy
   - Add X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
   - Enable HSTS for HTTPS connections

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Use secure session management
   - Validate all tokens properly

### Best Practices

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of security controls
   - Fail securely - deny by default
   - Principle of least privilege

2. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Run security tests in CI/CD
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Penetration testing

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Log security events
   - Monitor for anomalies
   - Incident response plan

**Total: 81 Security Test Scenarios**

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Critical Vulnerabilities** - Address any failing tests that indicate security issues
2. **Run Full Test Suite** - Execute complete security audit with `npm run test:security`
3. **Review Generated Reports** - Check `security-report.json` and `SECURITY_REPORT.md`
4. **Implement Recommendations** - Follow security hardening guidelines
5. **Continuous Testing** - Integrate into CI/CD pipeline

## Files Location

All security tests are located in:

```
/home/william/git/puppeteer-mcp/testing/paperclips-game/security-tests/
```

The test suite is ready for comprehensive security validation of the puppeteer-mcp project.
