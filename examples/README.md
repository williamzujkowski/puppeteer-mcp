# Examples and Demonstrations

This directory contains example code and demonstrations for puppeteer-mcp.

## Directory Structure

### `automation-demos/paperclips/`

Complete automation demonstrations using the Paperclips game as a real-world example.

**Demo Scripts:**
- Browser health monitoring and crash simulation
- Comprehensive automation workflows
- Error handling demonstrations

**Performance Demos:**
- Concurrent session testing examples
- Scalability testing demonstrations  
- Resource monitoring examples
- Stress testing scenarios

**Error Handling Demos:**
- Network error recovery examples
- Timeout scenario handling
- Invalid selector fallback demonstrations
- JavaScript error recovery

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive test reports and visual guides
- Technical implementation documentation
- Maintenance recommendations

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate:

1. **Real-world browser automation scenarios**
2. **Error handling and recovery patterns**
3. **Performance monitoring and optimization**
4. **Health monitoring and diagnostics**
5. **Best practices for production deployment**

## Usage

The scripts in this directory are **examples and demonstrations** - they are not part of the test suite. They provide practical examples of how to use puppeteer-mcp in various scenarios.

## Migration Note

This content was previously in the `testing/` directory but was moved to `examples/` during project reorganization to clearly separate:
- **Production tests** (in `tests/` directory)
- **Examples and demos** (in `examples/` directory)

The actual test implementations have been integrated into the main test suite under `tests/`.
