## Critical Issues

### CRITICAL-001: MCP STDIO Browser Automation Failure

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Category**: Functional  
**Impact**: Primary use case non-functional

#### Issue Description

The MCP `execute-in-context` tool was failing when running in stdio mode (the standard mode for AI
assistants) due to a hard dependency on the REST adapter, which is not available in stdio mode.

#### Root Cause Analysis

```
Architecture Issue:
MCP Server (stdio) → execute-in-context tool → REST Adapter (not available) → Browser
                                                    ↑
                                              FAILURE POINT
```

The tool assumed the REST adapter would always be available, but in stdio mode (used by AI
assistants), only the core MCP protocol is available.
