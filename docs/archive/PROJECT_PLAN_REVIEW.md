- **Resource Pooling**: Browser pool architecture prevented resource exhaustion
- **Type-Safe Actions**: Strongly typed browser actions eliminated runtime errors
- **Event-Driven Design**: Real-time browser events enhanced user experience

### 2.3 Testing Strategy

- **Mock Framework**: Comprehensive Puppeteer mocking enabled fast unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing caught interaction bugs
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Ensured system met performance requirements

## 3. Areas for Improvement (Do Differently)

### 3.1 Code Quality Management

- **ESLint Configuration**: Should have addressed linting rules earlier in development
- **Consistent Formatting**: Some style inconsistencies remain (78 warnings)
- **Type Assertions**: Over-reliance on type assertions in some areas

### 3.2 Development Process

- **Incremental Linting**: Should fix linting issues as code is written
- **Regular Refactoring**: Some complex functions could have been simplified earlier
- **Dependency Management**: Better tracking of third-party dependency updates

### 3.3 Testing Gaps

- **Visual Regression Tests**: No automated screenshot comparison
- **Load Testing**: Limited stress testing of browser pool under heavy load
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Only Chrome/Chromium tested
