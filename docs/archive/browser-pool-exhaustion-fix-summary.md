# Browser Pool Exhaustion Fix Summary

## Problem

The browser pool was experiencing resource exhaustion because session deletion didn't properly clean
up browser resources (contexts and pages).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Deletion (`src/mcp/tools/session-tools.ts`)

- Added imports for `contextStore`, `getPageManager`, and `browserPool`
- Modified `deleteSession` method to:
  - Get all contexts for the session being deleted
  - Use page manager to close all pages for the session
  - Delete all contexts associated with the session
  - Log each cleanup operation for debugging
  - Continue with session deletion even if cleanup fails (graceful degradation)

### 2. Enhanced Browser Context Tool (`src/mcp/tools/browser-context.ts`)

- Added new methods:
  - `closeBrowserContext`: Closes a specific context and all its pages
  - `listBrowserContexts`: Lists all contexts for a session
- These provide explicit control over context lifecycle

### 3. Updated Tool Definitions (`src/mcp/tools/tool-definitions.ts`)

- Added two new MCP tools:
  - `close-browser-context`: For closing individual contexts
  - `list-browser-contexts`: For listing contexts by session

### 4. Updated Tool Handlers (`src/mcp/server-tool-handlers.ts`)

- Added handlers for the new context management tools

## Key Benefits

1. **Resource Cleanup**: Sessions now properly clean up all browser resources when deleted
2. **Explicit Control**: New tools allow explicit context management
3. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging provides visibility into cleanup operations
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Cleanup errors don't prevent session deletion
5. **Cascade Cleanup**: Proper hierarchy: Session → Contexts → Pages

## Testing

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Manual test script confirms proper cleanup behavior
- Contexts are properly deleted when sessions are deleted
- Browser pool metrics show resources are released

## Recommendations for Production

1. Monitor browser pool metrics to ensure resource exhaustion is resolved
2. Consider adding periodic cleanup tasks for orphaned contexts
3. Add metrics/alerting for cleanup failures
4. Consider implementing context timeouts as an additional safety measure
