#### üåê Puppeteer Browser Automation
- Complete browser automation with 13 action types:
  - Navigation: `navigate`, `goBack`, `goForward`, `reload`
  - Interaction: `click`, `type`, `select`, `upload`, `hover`, `focus`, `blur`
  - Content: `evaluate`, `screenshot`, `pdf`, `content`
  - Utility: `wait`, `scroll`, `keyboard`, `mouse`, `cookies`
- Enterprise-grade browser pool management with health monitoring
- Page lifecycle management with session persistence
- Security framework with XSS prevention and input validation
- Real-time browser event streaming
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- **Architecture**: 50+ TypeScript files with modular design

- Input sanitization and validation on all endpoints

#### üìä Platform Features
- Multi-protocol support (REST, gRPC, WebSocket, MCP)
- Unified session management across all protocols
- In-memory session store (Redis-ready interface)
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Docker support with multi-stage builds
- Health monitoring and graceful shutdown
- Production-ready infrastructure

### Fixed
