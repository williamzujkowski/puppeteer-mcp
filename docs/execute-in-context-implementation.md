# Execute-in-Context Tool Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the `execute-in-context` tool for the MCP server, which allows LLMs and AI agents to execute commands within browser contexts.

## Implementation Details

### Tool Definition

The tool was added to the MCP server's tools array with the following specification:

```typescript
{
  name: 'execute-in-context',
  description: 'Execute commands in a browser context',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      contextId: { type: 'string', description: 'Context ID to execute command in' },
      command: { type: 'string', description: 'Command to execute' },
      parameters: { type: 'object', description: 'Parameters for the command' },
    },
    required: ['contextId', 'command'],
  },
}
```

### Tool Handler

The handler was added to the CallToolRequestSchema switch statement:

```typescript
case 'execute-in-context':
  return await this.executeInContextTool(args);
```

### Implementation Method

The `executeInContextTool` method was implemented with the following features:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validates that contextId is provided
   - Validates that command is provided
   - Returns appropriate error messages for missing parameters

2. **REST Adapter Integration**
   - Uses the REST adapter to call `/v1/contexts/:contextId/execute`
   - Sends the command as `action` and parameters as `params` in the request body
   - Supports optional session authentication

3. **Response Handling**
   - Parses the MCP response from the REST adapter
   - Handles JSON parsing errors gracefully
   - Returns the result in standard MCP format

4. **Error Handling**
   - Catches and logs errors appropriately
   - Returns user-friendly error messages
   - Preserves MCP-specific errors

### Security Compliance

The implementation includes:
- NIST control tags: `@nist ac-3` (Access enforcement) and `@nist au-3` (Content of audit records)
- Proper logging of all operations
- Support for session-based authentication

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Execute a navigation command in a browser context
const result = await mcpClient.callTool('execute-in-context', {
  contextId: 'ctx-123',
  command: 'navigate',
  parameters: {
    url: 'https://example.com'
  },
  sessionId: 'session-456' // Optional
});
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite was created to verify:
- Successful command execution
- Input validation (missing contextId, missing command)
- Session authentication handling
- Error handling for REST adapter failures
- Graceful handling of unparseable responses

## Integration

This tool integrates seamlessly with the existing multi-protocol API platform:
- Uses the same REST endpoint (`/v1/contexts/:contextId/execute`) that's available via REST API
- Leverages the existing authentication infrastructure
- Follows the same patterns as other MCP tools in the system
