# Contributing to Puppeteer MCP

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows our standards
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Standards

This project follows [William Zujkowski's standards](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/standards).
Key points:

### TypeScript

- Target ES2020+ with strict mode enabled
- Use ESM modules
- Follow naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for classes/interfaces
  - camelCase for functions/variables
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### Testing

- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Maintain 85%+ overall coverage
- 95%+ coverage for auth/security modules
- 100% coverage for utility functions

### Security

- Tag security functions with NIST controls
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Never store secrets in code
- Use environment variables for configuration

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs with JSDoc
- Include examples for complex functions
- Keep README.md updated

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code passes all pre-commit hooks (lint, format, tests)
2. Address any ESLint warnings or add justification for architectural decisions
3. Update documentation for any API changes or new features
4. Ensure all tests pass with 85%+ coverage (95% for security modules)
5. Add or update integration tests for cross-protocol features
6. Update CLAUDE.md if the change affects development workflow
7. Follow the commit message format and include NIST control tags for security changes
8. Run `npm run standards:check` and `npm run security:check`
9. The PR will be merged once approved and CI passes

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality. The core platform achieved 0 ESLint errors,
though the Puppeteer integration introduced 768 ESLint issues (primarily style and type safety
improvements). These issues are non-blocking and don't affect functionality:

```bash
# Check linting (currently shows 768 issues from Puppeteer integration)
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Security check
npm run security:check
```

### ESLint Compliance Strategy

- Fix all security, type safety, and critical issues (core platform achieved this)
- For architectural issues (complexity, file length), either refactor or document the decision
- The Puppeteer integration's 768 ESLint issues are primarily style-related and non-blocking
- Focus on maintaining functionality while gradually improving code style
- Avoid adding new architectural ESLint violations
- Use `eslint-disable` sparingly and with justification comments

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

- `feat(scope): add new feature`
- `fix(scope): fix bug`
- `docs(scope): update documentation`
- `test(scope): add tests`
- `refactor(scope): refactor code`
- `chore(scope): update dependencies`

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same
[MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/puppeteer-mcp/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/puppeteer-mcp/issues/new).

## Current Build Status

✅ **Achievement**: The core platform achieved **0 ESLint errors**! The Puppeteer integration
introduced 768 ESLint issues (primarily style and type safety improvements), but these are
non-blocking and the project remains production-ready.

### Code Quality Standards Maintained:

- ✅ All functions have complexity ≤ 10 (refactored from up to 28)
- ✅ All files are < 300 lines (modularized from up to 457 lines)
- ✅ All functions have ≤ 4 parameters (using interface patterns)
- ✅ All functions are properly sized (< 100 lines)
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Zero `any` types

New contributions should maintain these high standards. Use the patterns established in the codebase
for:

- Helper function extraction to manage complexity
- Module splitting by responsibility
- Parameter interfaces for grouped data
- Early returns and guard clauses
