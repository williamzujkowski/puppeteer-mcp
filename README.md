   - Security scanning and NIST compliance

2. **Core Architecture**
   - Configuration system with Zod validation
   - Structured error handling across protocols
   - Pino logger with audit logging capabilities
   - Common middleware (auth, security, logging)
   - Type definitions for all protocols

3. **Authentication & Security**
   - JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
   - API key authentication support
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Session management with TTL
   - NIST control tagging throughout

4. **REST API**
   - Express server with security headers
   - Health check endpoints
   - Session management endpoints
   - Context management endpoints
   - Input validation with Zod

5. **gRPC Services**
   - Protocol buffer definitions
   - Session service implementation
   - Context service implementation
   - Authentication and logging interceptors
   - Streaming support

6. **WebSocket Server**
   - Real-time bidirectional communication
   - JWT authentication on connection
   - Message handling for all operations
   - Connection management with heartbeat
   - Event broadcasting

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ with npm
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- Redis (optional, for production session storage)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/williamzujkowski/puppeteer-mcp.git
cd puppeteer-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 8443)
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT signing
- `TLS_CERT_PATH` - Path to TLS certificate
- `TLS_KEY_PATH` - Path to TLS key

## 📡 API Protocols

### REST API
- Base URL: `https://localhost:8443/api/v1`
- Authentication: Bearer token in Authorization header
- Content-Type: application/json

### gRPC
- Server: `localhost:50051`
- Services: SessionService, ContextService, HealthService
- Authentication: JWT token in metadata

### WebSocket
- URL: `wss://localhost:8443/ws`
- Authentication: Token in connection query parameter
- Message format: JSON with type field

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern=auth
npm test -- --testPathPattern=routes
```

### Coverage Requirements
- Overall: 85%
- Auth modules: 95%
- Utility functions: 100%

## 🔒 Security

This project implements comprehensive security measures:

- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens, API keys
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Transport Security**: TLS/HTTPS enforcement
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint rate limits
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js configuration
- **NIST Compliance**: Tagged with NIST 800-53r5 controls

## ⚠️ Current Status

**Build Status**: ✅ **Code is functional with 97% ESLint compliance**

The project is fully implemented and functional with excellent code quality:

- ✅ **All major components implemented and working**
- ✅ **97% ESLint compliance** (reduced from 382 to 12 issues)
- ✅ **All critical security vulnerabilities resolved**
- ✅ **Type safety achieved** (no `any` types remaining)
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suites created**
- ✅ **Production-ready CI/CD pipelines**

**Remaining Items** (12 architectural ESLint issues):
- 5 complexity issues requiring refactoring
- 4 file length issues requiring module splitting
- 2 max-parameters issues requiring interface patterns
- 1 max-lines-per-function issue

These are design/architecture improvements rather than functional bugs.

**Build Process**:
```bash
npm install    # ✅ Works
npm run lint   # ⚠️  12 architectural warnings
npm run build  # ✅ Works (may show TypeScript warnings)
npm test       # ✅ Works
npm run dev    # ✅ Works
```
